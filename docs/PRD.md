# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision  
To create a lightweight, end-to-end urban data analytics platform that enables users to ingest, transform, and visualize public datasets (e.g., mobility, weather, and civic service data) — simulating key elements of Palantir Foundry on a smaller, open-source scale. This project will showcase backend engineering, data pipeline development, and analytical storytelling with real data.

### 1.2 Target Audience  
- **Primary Users:**
  - Junior developers building data engineering portfolios
  - Hiring managers or engineers at data-focused companies (e.g., Palantir)
  - City planners and civic hackers exploring urban data

- **Secondary Users:**
  - Students and instructors in data science or civic tech courses
  - Non-profits needing low-cost analytics for open data

- **User Demographics:**
  - Age: 20–45
  - Background: Computer science, urban planning, public policy, data analytics
  - Location: Primarily urban/metro areas with open data availability

### 1.3 Problem Statement  
Despite the increasing availability of civic datasets (bike-sharing, weather, 311 complaints), most individuals and small teams lack tools to easily integrate, analyze, and derive insight from them. Existing platforms are either too complex or too limited in scope. This project bridges the gap by delivering a replicable, transparent mini-Foundry focused on public urban data.

## 2. Product Features

### 2.1 Core Features

1. **Dataset Ingestion Module**  
   - **Description:** Upload or fetch datasets (e.g., Divvy CSVs, NOAA weather API) and store them in a structured format  
   - **User Value:** Enables raw public data to be stored, tracked, and reused  
   - **Priority:** High

2. **Transformation Pipeline**  
   - **Description:** Apply filters, joins, aggregations, and data cleaning steps to generate analytic-ready datasets  
   - **User Value:** Automates repeatable, traceable analysis workflows  
   - **Priority:** High

3. **Interactive Dashboard UI**  
   - **Description:** Visualize trends such as bike usage vs. weather or complaint density by neighborhood  
   - **User Value:** Communicates insights clearly to both technical and non-technical users  
   - **Priority:** High

4. **Data Lineage Tracking**  
   - **Description:** Track and display how each dataset was generated (source → transform → result)  
   - **User Value:** Improves reproducibility and auditability  
   - **Priority:** Medium

### 2.2 Future Features
- Role-based access control
- Stream processing integration (e.g., live Divvy data)
- ML module for forecasting or classification
- More data source connectors (e.g., 311 APIs, air quality monitors)

## 3. User Stories

### 3.1 Primary User Stories
1. As a **data engineer**, I want to upload and transform public data so that I can build a reusable analytics pipeline.  
2. As a **Palantir recruiter**, I want to review this project to see if the candidate understands backend data workflows like Foundry.  
3. As a **civic analyst**, I want to explore the relationship between weather and bike usage so I can recommend infrastructure changes.

### 3.2 Secondary User Stories
- As an **instructor**, I want to assign a ready-to-use project that helps students learn data pipelines and visualization.
- As a **non-profit**, I want to analyze 311 complaints to advocate for faster services in underserved neighborhoods.

## 4. Success Metrics

### 4.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Data pipeline execution success rate**: ≥ 95%  
- **End-to-end pipeline runtime** (from ingestion to visualization): < 3 minutes per 1-month dataset  
- **GitHub stars / forks**: 50+ within 3 months  

### 4.2 User Engagement Metrics
- **Time to first insight** (from setup to dashboard): < 15 minutes  
- **API usage count** (per core endpoint): 100+ hits by demo users  
- **Page views on dashboard**: ≥ 200 unique visitors

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- Handle ingestion of ~100,000 records per dataset without crashing  
- Join and transform datasets with response time < 1s for simple queries  

### 5.2 Security Requirements
- Prevent arbitrary file uploads or code injection via APIs  
- Secure any exposed endpoints using basic token or JWT-based auth  
- Log all actions with timestamps for audit (e.g., dataset added, pipeline run)

## 6. Timeline and Milestones

### 6.1 Phase 1 (Week 1–2)
- **Milestone 1**: Set up project scaffold, Docker, and database — *[Date]*  
- **Milestone 2**: Implement CSV ingestion + NOAA weather API client — *[Date]*

### 6.2 Phase 2 (Week 3–4)
- **Milestone 1**: Add transformation logic + SQL/Join pipeline — *[Date]*  
- **Milestone 2**: Build dashboard UI with sample charts — *[Date]*  
- **Milestone 3**: Write documentation, polish README, record demo — *[Date]*

## 7. Constraints and Limitations
- Project is designed for local/small deployment; not intended for big data scale  
- Real-time ingestion and heavy ML not supported in MVP  
- API is unauthenticated by default (add basic auth if needed)
